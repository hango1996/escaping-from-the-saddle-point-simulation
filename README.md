# escaping from the saddle point
this repository do the simulation of two classical methods to escape from the saddle point.
The first one is Jin C, Ge R, Netrapalli P, et al. How to escape saddle points efficiently.
The second one is Natasha 2: Faster non-convex optimization than sgd.
These two simulation is accomplished using Python. 
We also do the time complexity test in the end.
